# Image-Classification-Project
Developed an image classification model using Python and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically categorize images into predefined classes. The project involved preprocessing image datasets, building a deep learning model, training it for high accuracy, and evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
